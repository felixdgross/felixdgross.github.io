One of theses so different viewpoints sometimes brought is beautifully expressed in the poem "please call me by my true names" by Thich Nhat Hanh:

Don’t say that I will depart tomorrow —<br>
even today I am still arriving.

Look deeply: every second I am arriving<br>
to be a bud on a Spring branch,<br>
to be a tiny bird, with still-fragile wings,<br>
learning to sing in my new nest,<br>
to be a caterpillar in the heart of a flower,<br>
to be a jewel hiding itself in a stone.

I still arrive, in order to laugh and to cry,<br>
to fear and to hope.

The rhythm of my heart is the birth and death<br>
of all that is alive.

I am the mayfly metamorphosing<br>
on the surface of the river.<br>
And I am the bird<br>
that swoops down to swallow the mayfly.

I am the frog swimming happily<br>
in the clear water of a pond.<br>
And I am the grass-snake<br>
that silently feeds itself on the frog.

I am the child in Uganda, all skin and bones,<br>
my legs as thin as bamboo sticks.<br>
And I am the arms merchant,<br>
selling deadly weapons to Uganda.

I am the twelve-year-old girl,<br>
refugee on a small boat,<br>
who throws herself into the ocean<br>
after being raped by a sea pirate.<br>
And I am the pirate,<br>
my heart not yet capable<br>
of seeing and loving.

I am a member of the politburo,<br>
with plenty of power in my hands.<br>
And I am the man who has to pay<br>
his “debt of blood” to my people<br>
dying slowly in a forced-labor camp.

My joy is like Spring, so warm<br>
it makes flowers bloom all over the Earth.<br>
My pain is like a river of tears,<br>
so vast it fills the four oceans.

Please call me by my true names,<br>
so I can hear all my cries and my laughter at once,<br>
so I can see that my joy and pain are one.

Please call me by my true names,<br>
so I can wake up,<br>
and so the door of my heart<br>
can be left open,<br>
the door of compassion.

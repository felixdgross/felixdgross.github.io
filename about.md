subtitle: Trying to superspread thoughts. 
---
One often assumes knowledge is absolute and universally accessible. But mostly we search for what we know only. So, knowledge rather spreads like a virus, from social circle to social circle. Thus, this site should help me be a superspreader of thoughts in my social circles. 
I want to spread interesting, rarely novel, rather na√Øve thoughts in the fields of psychology, philosophy and climate change. While spreading, I want to always keep the incomplete truth of thoughts in mind. This incompleteness is reflected in the website's name and explained in the [first post.](https://felixdgross.github.io/2022-09-11-Truth-is-what-works/) All pictures are either taken from [unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) or [pexels](https://www.pexels.com/de-de/suche/three%20apes/). Other than that, I use this site as an incentive to write more, signal my virtues and hopefully stimulate discussion.

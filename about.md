subtitle: Trying to superspread thoughts. 
---
One often assumes knowledge is absolute and universally accessible. But mostly we search for what we know only. Knowledge rather spreads like a virus, from social circle to social circle. Thus, this site should help me be a superspreader of thoughts in my social circles. I want to spread interesting, rarely novel, rather na√Øve thoughts in the fields of psychology, philosophy and climate change.  
Other than that, I use it as an incentive to write more, signal my virtues and hopefully spark discussion.
